 FAANMG Problem #30 {Medium}

0-1 Knapsack Problem | DP-10

Time Complexity : O(MN)

m = No of elements in the Weight
n = Capacity 

Space Complexity : O(MN)


Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
  

We are using a 2D matrix to store the maximum value in the capacity

for each cell we will check the max of the previous value at the dp[i-1][j] place with 
the current value + the dp[i-1][j - weights[i-1]
