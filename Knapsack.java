//TC: O(w*c), w: number of weights given, c: capacity
//SC: O(w*c)
// Approach:
//1. Brute force will be to build a tree with two child nodes of every node, corresponding to whether we take the first weight in the array or not.
//2. We see repeated subproblems, and hence can optimize it with DP.
//3. 2-D matrix, dp will store the maximum profit possible provided the capacity at any given point of time.
//4. We build dp[][] with size of (number of weights * capacity), capacity varying from 0 to the given capacity in input.
//5. Till the column, where we see the weight is greater than the capacity, we copy the values from the last row.
//6. If the capacity is equal to or greather than the weight, then we take the maximum of the same column last row element from dp[][] (which is the possible profit
// if the current weight is not included at all, and the profit of picking the current weight + the value in dp[][] at index -> [current column(j) - current weight]
// in the last row, (not the current row, because the current weight can only be used once, no duplicate weights are allowed).
//7. Last row last column gives us the maximum profit possible.
