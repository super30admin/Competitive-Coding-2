/**
 * Solution to the Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming
 * 
 * The Naive way to approach this problem would be by generating all possible
 * subsets and find the optimal one amongst them. The time complexity of this
 * apporach is O(2^n) as in the worst case we would be generating all possible
 * subsets.
 * 
 * To Be or Not to Be: 
 *                                  not choose      choose 
 *                                       |              | 
 * Recurrence Relation: K(n, W) = K(n-1, W) + K(n-1, W - w); where w is the 
 * weight of the last item whose decision we made.
 * 
 * An other way to approach it that comes to mind is using greedy algorithm,
 * where we pick the item which is most promising. This is found by the ratio of
 * value to weight of the item, so once we have this value for the given item,
 * we can sort it, and then start picking one by one until we respect the
 * capacity constraints. 
 * But this approach is not correct, does not always give an optimal answer. 
 * Consider, item 1: 60/10 = 6, Item 2: 100/20 = 5, Item 3: 120/30 = 4
 * If we start of by picking up th emost promising ones, We would have Item 1
 * and Item 2, 60 + 100 = 160 worth value and remaining capacity is 20.
 * 
 * We use dynamic programming to store the solutions to overlapping subproblems.
 * Create a matrix (n+1) * (W + 1) in size.
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(n+1 * W+1)
 * Time Complexity: O(n+1 * W+1) Pseudo-polynomial runtime
