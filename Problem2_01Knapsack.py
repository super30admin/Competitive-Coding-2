# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of 
# capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
# In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1]
# which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
# Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out 
# the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this 
# subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick
# the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

#-----------------
# Time Complexity: 
#-----------------
# O(N*W): Need to iterate over every combination of N and W once. Where N
#         is the number of elements and W is the capacity. 
#         We consider all possible capacities between 1 and given capacity 
#         (W).
#------------------
# Space Complexity: 
#------------------
# O(W) - Need an array to store dp[] with values ranging from 1...W where W
#        is the capacity

# Leet Code Performance:

# Ran Successfully?: N/A (Question not on leetcode)

# Similar to Coin Change problem where we had to find minimum number of coins

        # from 0 to capacity. hence we need 1 extra element.
        dp = [0] * (capacity+1)

        n = len(weights)
