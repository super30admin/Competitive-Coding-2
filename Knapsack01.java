 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 *  In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n
 *   items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] 
 *   such that sum of the weights of this subset is 
 * smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
